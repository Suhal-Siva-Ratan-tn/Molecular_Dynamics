# Molecular_Dynamics

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to simulate the interactions and movements of particles (atoms, molecules) over time using the Molecular Dynamics approach. The simulation calculates forces between particles, integrates their equations of motion, and produces trajectories that capture the system's behavior. This repository provides both the code and documentation necessary to run and understand the simulation.
